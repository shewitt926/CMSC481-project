# Socket Programming Project
This is a socket programming project given by UMBC CMSC 481 (Computer Networks, FA 2025). The purpose of this project is to build a reliable version of UDP--rUDP. This will be completed with Python, though a C variant could be completed as well (I will not be doing that, just python).

Most of this project is templated for the student. However, there are various parts in `rSender.py` that are NOT given, and are implemented by me.
