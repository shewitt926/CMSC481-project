# Socket Programming Project
This is a socket programming project given by UMBC CMSC 481 (Computer Networks, FA 2025). The purpose of this project is to build a reliable version of UDP--namely rUDP. This will be completed with Python, though a C variant could be completed as well (I will not be doing that, just python).

Most of this project is templated for the student (me). However, there are various parts in `rSender.py` that are NOT given, and are implemented by me. 

## How To Run Testing
You will be using `rSender.py` for this project. Run the autograding script like so:

```bash
# format: python3 rSender.py <checkpoint 0-5>

# only checkpoint 0
$ python3 rSender.py 0

# test ALL checkpoints if no args
$ python3 rSender.py 
```
